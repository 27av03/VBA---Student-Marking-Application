Welcome to the Student Marking Application! This will serve as an application to store student grades and provide additional information about the final grades in each course.

•	This application allows users to connect to a database and see the specific grades for each student depending on the course they select

•	Through a UserForm, the user will select which course they would like to see data for

•	After selecting the desired course, the application will display the details of all the students that took that course and their grades for each assessment (Assignments, and exams) in a separate worksheet

•	Additionally, the final marks for each student in that course will be calculated in the Final Mark column

•	At the bottom of the Excel sheet, you will be able to see the specific statistics based on the Final Marks in the selected course (Average Grade, Min/Max Grade, and Standard Deviation)

•	The application will also automatically generate a Histogram showcasing the final marks of all the students in the selected course

•	Finally, all the data in the Excel sheet will be automatically copied into a Word document for the viewer to see
